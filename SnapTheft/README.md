# CyberWare Contest Nov. 2024
This project was apart of a local mini-contest to show the dangers of hacking and how easy it can be to steal user-information. The contestants were given 30 minutes to write a program that stores backdata on a user in a database. For this project, I created a mock-website of Snapchat.com's mobile interface. This looks very similar to the basic snapchat interface of your mobile phone, hit the "login" button, put in your email and password and it will then error out and store the data publicly in the `database.json` file which is just an array of usernames and passwords. Anybody can access the database by simply going to the "/database" endpoint of the current domain.
